# voting-app-server

This is the backend for my voting app project I made using React.

Find the frontend project [here](https://github.com/Ventuscoder/voting-app-react).

Main concepts I worked on in the backend part of this project:
1. Using mongoose to add and update database data
2. Using [render](https://render.com) to host my project
3. Using environment variables
4. Using Express.js to create a backend API
